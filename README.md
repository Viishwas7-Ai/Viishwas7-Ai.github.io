## ‚ö†Ô∏è Model Usage Notice

This beta version of **Enclyra AI Assistant** includes models such as:

- `openhermes:latest` (LLaMA-based)
- `Qwen` (QWER)
- Others: DeepSeek, Phi-3, etc.

These models are used **only for research, testing, and evaluation purposes** during the **free beta phase**. No part of this application may be used for commercial or production use unless the models are replaced with commercially-permissive alternatives.

If you support the project via a founder‚Äôs pack, you still receive the **same free beta version** as all users. Your donation supports future development and **does not constitute a commercial transaction** for the AI models.

We plan to replace these models in the upcoming **v1.x commercial release** with fully commercial-safe alternatives like `Gemma`, `Mistral`, `DeepSeek`, etc.
